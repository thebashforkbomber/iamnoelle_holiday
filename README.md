# I am Noelle Holiday
## and I am spinning
Joke discord activity. Made it because the Story of Undertale activity was AI generated and I wanted to spite on that.

If you want to set this up for yourself, just point your activity to https://thebashforkbomber.github.io/iamnoelle_holiday/. If you want it to be available everywhere, you can sign your life away to Discord and give Stripe your ID to verify your activity. Not doing it.
This also doesn't have the SDK. Too bad!
